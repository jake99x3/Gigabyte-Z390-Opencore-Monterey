# Gigabyte-Z390 I Aorus Pro WIfi Opencore 

This is my Hackintosh EFI repo. I have the mindset of sharing code, knowledge and all information espesially in order to help the next guy who buys this motherboard. It bothers me the moderators of www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh are so against this, detrimental to the community and it turns people away from said hackintosh community. 

This Repo has EFI's for i7 9700k Gigabyte z390 I Aorus Pro Wifi RX 5500 XT AND a seperate EFI for use with i5 8500 and UHD 630. 

Generate new SMBIOS values and choose your EFI accordingly
