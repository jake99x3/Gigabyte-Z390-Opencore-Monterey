Unzip folder and copy EFI folder + boot file to EFI directory of installer 

I have 2 of these boards both with a hackintosh install. 1 using UHD 630 and the other an RX 5500 XT

SMBIOS values removed

075 EFI is configured for RX 5500 XT GPU. 

"OCUHD630.zip" is for UHD 630. I use it to run Mac OS Monterey 

"OC082withGPU.zip" is for boards with RX 5500 XT GPU. I run Mac OS Ventura Beta with it

Select your EFI accordingly
